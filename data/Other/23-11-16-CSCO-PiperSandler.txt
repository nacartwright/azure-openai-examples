Piper Sandler analyst James Fish lowered the firm’s price target on Cisco to $50 from $57 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares following quarterly results. Shares weer down over 10% after-hours as the “airpocket” bears had been anticipating has come into reality, the firm notes. Cisco believes customers are digesting already shipped inventory over the next 1-2 quarters, resulting in a 6% cut to annual guide. Piper had concerns a third-cut was possible given the environment and that this could be just the start of an enterprise slowdown that may leave weak orders in place rather than re-accelerate as Cisco plans in the second half of the year. The Splunk deal is likely a positive for Cisco over the medium-term, but given the core dynamics, Cisco is likely to remain range-bound given an already lowered valuation, says the firm.

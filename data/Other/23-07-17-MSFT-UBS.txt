Microsoft upgraded at UBS on cloud and AI
UBS upgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $400 from $345 given evidence of stabilizing cloud infrastructure spending, positive near-term AI catalysts, and an attractive valuation.

According to the bank, Azure/AWS is stabilizing after a significant slowdown last year. While the overall market conditions remain challenging, the firm suggests that the worst may be behind us, as their checks indicate the backdrop is no longer deteriorating, as well as partners reported a gradual recovery in new bookings discussions.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Receives Buy Rating and $200 Price Target from BMO Capital
BMO Capital's Brian Pitz initiated their coverage on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. According to Pitz, Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing trend of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Pitz stated, "Riding secular Cloud tailwinds throughout 2024 and beyond, AWS will 'lead the foundational and middle layer of the gen AI/ML stack.'" This bullish prediction suggests that Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, will play a crucial role in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.

In addition to its cloud business, Pitz also highlighted Amazon's plans for its retail segment. The analyst believes that the company will invest in smaller same-day buildings with lower capital expenditure, aimed at improving the overall customer experience. Pitz noted, "This strategy will unlock free cash flow for Amazon, further strengthening its financial position." By focusing on enhancing the customer experience, Amazon aims to maintain its dominant position in the retail industry and drive revenue growth.

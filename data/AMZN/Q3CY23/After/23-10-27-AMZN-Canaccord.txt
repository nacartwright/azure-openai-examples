Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham maintained a Buy rating on Amazon (AMZN – Research Report) yesterday and set a price target of $170.00.

Michael Graham’s Buy rating on Amazon’s stock is based on several factors that highlight the company’s positive financial standing and future growth potential. Firstly, Amazon’s Q3 results were robust, with profitability surpassing expectations due to efficient regionalization of its fulfillment network. This has resulted in reduced delivery distances and costs. Furthermore, the company’s online stores reaped benefits from a record-breaking Prime Day event while categories such as beauty and personal health remained strong. Despite economic uncertainties, customers continued to rely on Amazon for their household essentials.

In addition to its strong retail performance, Amazon’s Cloud Computing segment, AWS, displayed consistent growth, matching Q2 levels. Despite cost optimization efforts by clients, new deals were being signed for additional workloads. Amazon’s focus on investing in Generative AI as a key priority also contributes to Graham’s positive outlook. Amazon’s Q4 revenue guidance was slightly below consensus, but the profitability outlook exceeded expectations due to the successful regionalization of its fulfillment network. Despite the stock being 18% below its recent highs, Graham remains optimistic due to Amazon’s strong fundamental performance and reasonable valuation.

According to TipRanks, Graham is a 5-star analyst with an average return of 12.6% and a 55.19% success rate. Graham covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Amazon, EverQuote, and Uber Technologies.

In another report released today, Roth MKM also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $165.00 price target.

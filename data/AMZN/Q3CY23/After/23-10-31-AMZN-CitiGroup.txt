Citi Raises Amazon Price Target to $177 Rating 'Buy'
$Citigroup(C.US)$ reported that $Amazon(AMZN.US)$ reported better-than-expected Q3 results as AWS demand looks to be stabilizing, excluding the impact of foreign exchange grew 12% y/y, North American retail revenue rose 11% y/y, and operating profit reached $11.2 billion, well above the high end of the guidance range (between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion). 
The bank believes AWS is well-positioned for growth acceleration as optimization headwinds abate, primarily due to a shift in consumption to necessities, allowing Amazon to gain further share of the consumer silver packet and expand gross margins at the same time. On AWS, the bank believes that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) momentum continues to grow, and that a revamped Amazon regionalized network may lead to improved delivery speeds, higher commission rates and increased order frequency for premium members, even as customer discretionary spending may be challenged. The bank raised its price target from $167 to $177 and maintained its rating at 'Buy'

Amazon (AMZN) Beats Expectations with Impressive Q3 2023 Earnings
DA Davidson's Tom Forte raised their price target on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) by 4.7% from $150 to $157 on 2023/10/27. The analyst maintained their Strong Buy rating on the stock.

Forte's decision to raise the price target on Amazon comes after the company's impressive performance in the third quarter of 2023. In their assessment of Amazon's Q3 2023 report, Forte noted that both the company's top and bottom lines beat the Street's and DA Davidson's expectations.

Amazon reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 for Q3 2023, surpassing the $0.28 EPS reported in Q3 2022 by a staggering 235.7%. The company's revenue for the quarter reached $143.08 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141.52 billion and marking a 12.6% increase from Q3 2022's $127.1 billion.

Furthermore, Amazon's operating income for Q3 2023 stood at $11.2 billion. Looking ahead, the company's management provided guidance for Q4 2023, expecting revenue in the range of $160 billion to $167 billion and operating income between $7 billion and $11 billion.

Despite ongoing legal challenges, including the recent antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission, Amazon's management did not comment on the matter during the earnings call. However, Forte emphasized that DA Davidson is closely monitoring the situation.

CEO Andy Jassy expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting the progress in cost efficiency and delivery speed within the Stores business, stable growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), robust advertising revenue, and overall increases in operating income and free cash flow.

Jassy also highlighted the benefits of expanding Amazon's fulfillment network, which has propelled the company toward achieving its fastest-ever delivery speeds for Prime customers. Additionally, Jassy emphasized the advancements made in generative artificial intelligence (AI) through AWS, with notable customers such as adidas, Booking.com, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips, and United Airlines utilizing AWS for their generative AI workloads.

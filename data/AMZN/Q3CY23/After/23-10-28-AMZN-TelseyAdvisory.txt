Amazon's strong Q3 results and management's solid Q4 guidance have continued to impress analysts. The company's Q3 2023 report, released on October 26, showcased impressive numbers across the board. Amazon reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94, beating Q3 2022's EPS of $0.28 by a remarkable 235.7%. The company's revenue for Q3 2023 stood at $143.08 billion, surpassing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141.52 billion and Q3 2022's revenue of $127.1 billion by 12.6%. Operating income for the quarter reached $11.2 billion.

Looking ahead, Amazon's management provided guidance for Q4 2023. The company expects revenue to be in the range of $160 billion to $167 billion, with operating income projected to be between $7 billion and $11 billion. CEO Andy Jassy expressed his satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting the progress made in cost-to-serve and delivery speed in the Stores business, stable growth in AWS, robust advertising revenue, and significant increases in overall operating income and free cash flow.

In addition to the positive outlook from Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman, other analysts also updated their ratings for Amazon on October 27, 2023:
